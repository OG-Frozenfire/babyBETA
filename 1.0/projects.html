This media influence does not just affect how we view one another, but affects us on a much more personal level, our happiness. Because we live in the this consumeristic world, we are feed with the idea that success is to make lots of money, to buy a large house, and have a family to continue the cycle and <span style="font-weight:bold"> feed into the system. </span> This encourages us toTo buy, buy and buy some more, and to believe that. That our happiness is defined by our material possessions and how much we have. Misleading the masses with an untrue definition of success, keeping them in pursuit of the wrong goal. An unattainable goal, because there will always be something bigger, better. We can’t be content with what we have, so you’ll never attain that concept of success, keeping you in the never-ending pursuit of happiness. 
This is why we must constantly be self-reflective, to be aware of what we are exposed to and how that alters our view of the world. OThat our governments are created and run by humans like us, who make mistakes just like us. Brave New World and 1984 remind us to remain cautious of the government and their use of new technologies, be it the media or more extreme aspects like control of the population and creating clones. It warns us to remember that success is really happiness, not vise versa, and to. To constantly be thinking and considering the world and people around us, and how theyit affects us. To be constantly self-reflective. Closing out, I leave you with a last concept to ponder at: If ignorance is bliss, what kind of world would you create?
