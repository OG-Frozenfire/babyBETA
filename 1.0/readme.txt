1.0: This build is the first ever. Very basic, used for learning and getting used to programming. It's main features are 
a working index page linked with the rest, a page of basic css.
EDIT: "index2.html" is a newer verison of the old code. These files are unorganized and were used for practicing uploading to git.
Feel free to browse these files, but I won't be updating this respository- I'll be making a different one. 

Books referenced for this build:
    SamsTeachYourself HTML and CSS in 24 Hours, Julie C. Meloni & Michael Morrison
    Dynamic Web Programming, Marty Matthews and John Cronan
